This [notebook](https://github.com/theeugenekim/dog-vision-tensorflow/blob/main/dog_vision_machine_learning.ipynb) contains the code for a dog breed classifier using transfer Learning and Tensorflow/Keras.

It's also a run through of using an existing MobileNetv2 model on a dog breed dataset.

The dataset can be pulled from the [Dog Vision Kaggle Compeition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification).

For more information on MobileNetv2 check out the documentation at [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4).

All the files required are within this repository, although you may need to customize a your Google Drive to make your filenames consistent when savings logs or reading images, for example.
